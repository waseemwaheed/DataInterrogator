title: D3 - visualizing temperature
---

Today's post is a bit delayed, anyway, I went through the same data from [day 1](https://waseemwaheed.github.io/2017/06/29/D3js-1.html) (temperature measurements) but this time I, used leaflet.js instead of google maps API starting from from the [example](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/9267535). The beautiful thing about leaflet is that it doesn't abstract the whole DOM event-handling like in google maps which means events set using d3 are handled normally.

I have manged to encoded the data in color, size and in text in the form of tool-tips.
