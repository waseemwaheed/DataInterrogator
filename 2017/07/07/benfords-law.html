<h1 id="benfords-law">Benford’s law</h1>
<p>Few days ago, I was introduced to the Benford’s law of distribution. Looking up the internet for accessible explanation, I came across a basic introduction with very interesting explanation on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/logarithmic-scale/v/vi-and-sal-talk-about-the-mysteries-of-benford-s-law">Khan Academy</a>. Sal mentioned the typical example of the world countries populations follow this fascinating distribution function.</p>

<p>After few seconds thinking about it, I decided to confirm this claim, So, I quickly pulled the data from wikipedia  and coded a quick and dirty experiment. And sure it works as you can see bellow</p>
