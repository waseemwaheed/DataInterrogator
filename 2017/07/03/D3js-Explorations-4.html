<p>Today’s post is a bit delayed, anyway, I went through the same data from <a href="https://waseemwaheed.github.io/2017/06/29/D3js-1.html">day 1</a> (temperature measurements) but this time I, used leaflet.js instead of google maps API starting from from the <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/9267535">example</a>. The beautiful thing about leaflet is that it doesn’t abstract the whole DOM event-handling like in google maps which means events set using d3 are handled normally.</p>

<p>I have manged to encoded the data in color, size and in text in the form of tool-tips.</p>
