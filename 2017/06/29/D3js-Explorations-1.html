<p>This is the first day of the challenge but I have been tinkering with D3 for few days now.</p>

<p>My first day started with an intention to project points on a map so, I had a look at few examples by they seemed complicated so I adjusted my aims from drawing the map with d3 to mapping the data with d3 and get the map from a map provider (google maps or leaflet). I started with an <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3107023042306299650/2074946897315352283?hl=en#">example</a> by Mike Bostock which is very accessible and I adapted it.
My data that I had which is the locations of temperature sensors spread across the US (source : <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3107023042306299650/2074946897315352283?hl=en#">GSOD</a>) as well as summary temperature measurement for one day. Iâ€™m happy with the result for today as I managed to project the sensors on the map and color coded the points based on temperature measurement.</p>

<p>My adapted version of the code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/waswas15/d3js-one-month-challenge">github</a></p>

<p>Future directions :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw connections between nodes</li>
  <li>include a slider to select the day of the year.</li>
</ol>
