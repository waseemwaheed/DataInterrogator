Looking up the internet for accessible explanation, I came across a basic introduction with very interesting explanation on Khan Academy. Sal mentioned the typical example of the world countries populations follow this fascinating distribution function. . After few seconds of thinking about it, I decided to confirm this claim, So, I quickly pulled the data from wikipedia and coded a quick and dirty experiment. And sure it works as you can see bellow . . Code and data can be found in my GitHub .",

            "content": "Today’s post is a bit delayed, anyway, I went through the same data from day 1 (temperature measurements) but this time I, used leaflet.js instead of google maps API starting from from the example. The beautiful thing about leaflet is that it doesn’t abstract the whole DOM event-handling like in google maps which means events set using d3 are handled normally. . I have manged to encoded the data in color, size and in text in the form of tool-tips. . . The code can be found at here .",

            "content": "I started today with a goal to plot data from Melbourne city particularly Melbourne Bike Share stations on google maps with marker size and color representing the size of the station and the availability of bikes respectively in addition to tooltips containing the details of each station on hover. . Mapping the data went smoothly but tooltips turned to be tricky, it took me some time to decide to postpone it to another stage. I think the problem has to do with google maps handling events not D3 so in other words events are not being passed to D3. Handling events with google maps is straight forward but finding the current location of the markers to compare with the current mouse position is not clear at this point. . Anyway, I think the visualization is still interesting. . .",

My first day started with an intention to project points on a map so, I had a look at few examples by they seemed complicated so I adjusted my aims from drawing the map with d3 to mapping the data with d3 and get the map from a map provider (google maps or leaflet). I started with an example by Mike Bostock which is very accessible and I adapted it. My data that I had which is the locations of temperature sensors spread across the US (source : GSOD) as well as summary temperature measurement for one day. I’m happy with the result for today as I managed to project the sensors on the map and color coded the points based on temperature measurement. . My adapted version of the code can be found on my github . . Future directions : . Draw connections between nodes | include a slider to select the day of the year. |",
