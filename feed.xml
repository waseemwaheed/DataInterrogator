The task was very simple 😎: Coding challenge The aim of this exercise is to implement an “alerting” service which will consume a file of currency conversion rates and produce alerts. For the purpose of this coding exercise, you are allowed to choose a different programming language, provided that you provide us with a detailed instruction on how to build and run your program. Input The format of the file will simulate a stream of currency conversion rates. Each line will be properly structured JSON (http://jsonlines.org/): { “timestamp”: 1554933784.023, “currencyPair”: “CNYAUD”, “rate”: 0.39281 } The fields in the JSON record are: timestamp: the timestamp of the record in seconds since UNIX epoch, with fractional seconds specified currencyPair: the sell and buy currencies which the rate relates to rate: the conversion rate You may assume that for each currency pair, currency conversion rates are streamed at a constant rate of one per second. ie. for two consecutive “CNYAUD” entries in in the input file, they will have timestamps that differ by one second: { &quot;timestamp&quot;: 1554933784.023, &quot;currencyPair&quot;: &quot;CNYAUD&quot;, &quot;rate&quot;: 0.39281 } { &quot;timestamp&quot;: 1554933784.087, &quot;currencyPair&quot;: &quot;USDAUD&quot;, &quot;rate&quot;: 0.85641 } { &quot;timestamp&quot;: 1554933785.023, &quot;currencyPair&quot;: &quot;CNYAUD&quot;, &quot;rate&quot;: 0.39295 } Output The alerting service should produce the following alert as a JSON string output to standard output: when the spot rate for a currency pair changes by more than 10% from the 5 minute average for that currency pair The format of the alert produced should be: { “timestamp”: 1554933784.023, “currencyPair”: “CNYAUD”, “alert”: “spotChange” } As mentioned earlier, the task is very simple but I wanted to take the opportunity to improve the following aspects: Code readability Unit testing Deployability Code readability I use VSCODE for many tasks, and it is my main text editor so naturally, I looked for tools that play well with it. For automatic code styling, I used black which is a great code formatter. Additionally, I revised the PEP 8 guide to refresh my memory of best practices. Unit Testing The idea behind unit testing is that you have to arrange your code into non-coupled components to allow for testing. In the Python ecosystem there are few options such as the unittest which comes as part of the Python Standard Library and pytest. I ended up using pytest because I wanted to learn it. Deployability Python, similar to other interpreted languages, requires a compatible version of the interpreter and the same version of packages (excluding Javascript, where every computer nowadays comes with one). This is a common issue that has many solutions. Among those solutions are the virtual environments such as (venv, virtualenv, conda env) and containers such as the well-known docker. The simplicity and ubiquity of docker made it a simple choice 👍 for me in this challenge. Once the code is written and tested, docker image description file is all that is needed. The alternative path of virtual environment was also a viable one, I just had to write enviroment creation scripts, one for windows and one for Unix/Linux 🥱. My solution You can access the solution over here . Assumptions One input file can be consumed at a time. The frequency at which updates arrive is fixed (1s). Hence the average, in the general case, is taken over 300 samples. A single stream (input file) can contain more than one currency pair. Decisions To keep track of the exchange rates for each pair, I made the currency pairs keys of a dictionary which maps to sliding window deque data structure. The rationale behind choosing a dictionary is because, each new line can be new data point for a currency pair, which means the currency pairs data need to be accessed in random order and a dictionary is the best options here where an access operation is $O(1)$ The rationale behind choosing a deque is that it allows for the easy creation of a sliding window. A deque has $O(1)$ complexity when we append to or access the ends of the queue, which is what we are doing here. The CurrencyPairData class is a subclass of the Observable class. This allows me to easily add callbacks to CurrencyPairData instances. In the end The coding challenge was a fun opportunity to build something and get someone to give me feedback on my approach. Additionally, I had a ton of fun learning about pytest and docker which will definitely be used in my other projects.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Making the TITAN GTX GPU available to Tensorflow</title><link href="https://waseemwaheed.github.io/DataInvestig8or/python/linux/tensorflow/software%20engineering/2020/11/15/Making-TITAN-GTX-GPU-available-to-Tensorflow.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making the TITAN GTX GPU available to Tensorflow" /><published>2020-11-15T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://waseemwaheed.github.io/DataInvestig8or/python/linux/tensorflow/software%20engineering/2020/11/15/Making-TITAN-GTX-GPU-available-to-Tensorflow</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Python" /><category term="Linux" /><category term="Tensorflow" /><category term="Software Engineering" /><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Benford’s Law</title><link href="https://waseemwaheed.github.io/DataInvestig8or/analysis/probability/2017/07/07/benfords-law.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Benford’s Law" /><published>2017-07-07T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-07-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://waseemwaheed.github.io/DataInvestig8or/analysis/probability/2017/07/07/benfords-law</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Analysis" /><category term="Probability" /><summary type="html">Benford’s law Few days ago, I was introduced to the Benford’s law of distribution.
