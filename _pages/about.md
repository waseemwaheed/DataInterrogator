# About
Hi this is me ![Waseem Waheed](/images/profile.png)

My main skills are:
  * Software engineering (Python, Java, C)
  * Predictive analytics (R, Python)
  * Data analysis (SQL, R, Python, Excel)
  * Data visualization (PowerBI, matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot)
  * Technical writing

I have a PhD in Image processing, my main research area is continuous optimization techniques in signal and image processing.

My thesis is at the intersection of:

1. Optimization
2. Signal processing
3. Image processing
4. Graph theory

I currently work as a sessional lecturer in the computer science department at both La Trobe University and Charles Sturt Univesity. The subjects I teach include: Natural Language Processing, Internet Of Things, Wireless Communications/Networking.

In 2018, I spent 5 months at [Aurecon](https://www.aurecongroup.com/) working on three data science projects in the area of asset management, mainly developing image processing/computer vision and machine learning solutions targeted at streamlining asset management processes.

I am broadly interested in data science, computer vision, natural language processing, computer programming, computer networking and IT in general.
